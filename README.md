FORTRAN
---

Fortran (formerly FORTRAN, derived from "Formula Translation") is a general-purpose, 
imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and 
scientific computing. Originally developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and 
engineering applications. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran

The purpose of the GNU Fortran (GFortran) project is to develop the Fortran compiler 
front end and run-time libraries for GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection. GFortran 
development is part of the GNU Project. We seek to bring free number crunching 
to a broad spectrum of platforms and users.
